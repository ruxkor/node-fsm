Finite state machine module for node.js

State
Object to represent a single state

Table
So called Table based state machine. Sync steps

asyncTable
Table based fsm with async transitions. Everything here is evented and the syntax should me more of a event handler. It is based on the evented module for node. The idea is to use nodes main loop for the fsm's.
