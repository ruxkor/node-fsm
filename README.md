Finite state machine module for node.js

State
Object to represent a single state. The state is event based.


asyncTable
Table based fsm with async transitions. Everything here is evented and the syntax should me more of a event handler. It is based on the evented module for node. The idea is to use nodes main loop for the fsm's.

What can it implement
- Acceptor type FSM
- others fsm types will follow
